      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

          <li>A basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding of how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files.

        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.

CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web.Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like

      <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
        A <span>document</span> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — <a href="#" target="_blank">HTML</a> is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
      <p>
        CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

    <header class="h2">CSS Syntax</header>
    <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."</p>
    
   <p> The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
    <code class="mulLines_code">h1{
      color:blue;
      font-size:3.5rem;
    }</code>
    <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>We then have a set of curly braces <code>{ }</code>. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>
    <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.
    
      A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.
    </p>
    <code class="mulLines_code">h1{
       color:blue;
       font-size:3.5rem;
      }
      p{
      color:red
      }
    </code>

      <p>As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. You will also find links to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see below).</p>
      <p>At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.</p>
      <p>For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.</p>
